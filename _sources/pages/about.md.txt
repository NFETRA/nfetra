# About

NFETRA is all about low-angle normal faults.
NFETRA is an acronym that stands for *Low-angle normal faults: How do they form and what is their role for the Energy Transition?*
The project aims to compile and acquire key data sets and publications to provide an interactive 3D geoscientific database of relevant geological field sites..

Through NFETRA we aim to take geoscientific research and education to the next level - with the simple motto of placing all key information and data sets in their correct spatial positions.
We bring modern technology, in particular cost-effective digital outcrops, to complement more than 200 years of geoscientific research across the Alps.
Finally, NFETRA provides a sustainable platform for sharing results, workflows and teaching material with the wider geoscientific community.
